# Project Overview

**NOTE:** This is a different customised verison of the Employee Management System from our non-organization account. This version is targeted only for very minute and selective features that the respective company wants.

The Employee Management System is a command-line application developed using the Python programming language.

This system is tailored to optimize the handling of employee information, ensuring accuracy and security in the process.
